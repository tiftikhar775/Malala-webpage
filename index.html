        <h1>About Malala</h1>
        <p id="desc1">
            Malala Yousafzai was born in Swat Valley, more specifically Mingora, located in the northern area of Pakistan. 
            She belongs to a Yousafzai tribe known as the Pashtuns, who live by a code of honor and hospitality. 
            Malala is the daughter of  two very well-educated and knowledgeable parents; her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, 
            who is the founder of the Khushal School, and her pious and loving mother, Toor Pekai. Despite it being 
            the norm to prefer a boy to a girl as the male is able to provide and help the family financially, 
            Malala was still loved tremendously from both of her parents. Like her father's mother, she is described 
            as both a clever and funny girl. Throughout the book, Malala makes mention of the support and encouragement
            her father gives her about her future. Since a young age, Malala promotes and deeply understands 
            the importance of education, freedom, peace and has always had an innate sense of contributing to 
            the betterment of the world. In school, she was a highly competitive topper-student, always looking for ways 
            to improve herself. Given her background and her characteristics, it is no surprise that Malala Yousafzai
            has made such a monumental impact on the world and touched the hearts of millions across the globe.

        <h1>Malala's Courage</h1>
        <p id="desc2">
            Malala Yousafzai is a clear example of a strong and courageous figure who stands up for what is right. Upon 
            realizing the radicalism of her society, one which promotes false interpretations of Islam made by so called 
            Islamic Scholars, who push for girls to be in seclusion in their homes and be covered in Burqas, Malala sacrificed 
            her well-being and safety to stand up for herself and others in her community. Unfortunately however, the brave are
            often punished heavily before being recognized for their courage, and such was the case for Malala Yousafzai. Her 
            father was accused of committing blasphemy for letting his daughter and other girls to go to school, and for 
            standing up for the right of girls to have an education,   allowing them to safely study.  The Taliban became 
            ever rampant, killing those who did not oblige by their rules. Terror starts populating the country, there are 
            killings of mosque’s leaders, teachers, dancers, and suicide bombers become more frequent. Politician activist 
            Benazir Bhutto, gets assassinated. The situation becomes more and more dangerous for girls like Malala, yet despite
            all this her father still gave speeches and voiced his concerns for the people of her community, and consistently 
            risked his well-being for the betterment of everyone. It is not long before Malala herself begins to tread in her 
            fathers footsteps and campaign for peace and love across numerous speeches which are echoed across the globe. It 
            did not take long for her to become a recognized face of the resistance to the Taliban, becoming a powerful voice 
            and a well-known speaker, which further allowed her to embark on the path of politics to properly help her country. 
            Desmond Tutu nominates her for the International Peace Prize, and the Pakistani government awards her the National 
            Peace Prize, a prestigious recognition highlighting her efforts. Aware of her influence and power, Malala requested 
            the government to rebuild schools all across the nation, schools that were destroyed by the Taliban. The more 
            outspoken and stronger she became, the more of a target she had painted on her back, which eventually lead to an 
            unfortunate assassination attempt on her life, with a man stepping into her school bus and shooting her in the face 
            point blank in October of 2012.

        <h1>The Hopeful Present</h1>
        <p id="desc3">
            Malala Yousafzai was only fifteen years old when she had an assassination attempt made on her life. 
            The news reached all across the world, with it being a time of great sadness and grief for many around the world. 
            Fortunately however, Malala made an incredible recovery from the shooting, and was able to regain much of her 
            consciousness after some time. The left side of her face was left paralyzed after the attack, but it still did 
            not stop her from continuing to spread her messages and standing up for the people of her nation. In 2013, after 
            several operations and surgeries, Malala made a full recovery and left the hospital motivated, to use her story 
            to contribute to the world. She went back to school, where everyone there treated her like a celebrity instead than 
            a teenager like them. Despite this however, she remained dedicated and focused on her goals. It is clear that she 
            wants to be remembered as someone who stood up for education, not as the girl who survived after being shot by a 
            Taliban. Thanks to her perseverance, discipline and sheer willpower, Malala Yousafzai at only sixteen years old, 
            delivered her now well-renowned speech to the United Nations. As of today, when looking back at all of the 
            accomplishments of Malala Yousafzai, it is nothing short of incredible to see the amount of work she has 
            already accomplished in the short period of time she has been alive. As of today Malala has opened up her own
            school for girls alongside refurbishing hundreds of destroyed schools, she has been awarded several awards for 
            her courage and bravery, she has been successful in the campaigning of her nations education fund, with the 
            Prime Minister of Pakistan declaring a ten million dollar education fund in February of 2017, and so much more. 
            Thanks to her and her family's efforts and courage, millions of people across the world have a hopeful present,
            and a hopeful future to look forward to.

        <p id="desc4">
            I recall watching on the TV Malala's speech to the United Nations upon receiving the Nobel Price. 
            My mom immediately made remark on how such a young girl impacted the lives of so many people. Since she was 
            practicaly the same age as me only being two years older, I started conducting more research on her work and the 
            reason why she became famous. I knew that she was somebody who fought for the freedom of education and peace, but I 
            had no clue on the dynamics that made her become such a big influence. To me it was important the fact that she was
            recognized a Nobel Price and she was on TV, more than her cause and beliefs. I remember my dad questioning me about 
            her famous statement “One child, one teacher, one pen, and one book can change the world”. My interest
            and understanding towards her work became stronger as I continued watching her interviews and speeches on YouTube. 
            Her passion and determination made me reflect a lot about things I've always given for granted, such as going 
            to school or walking safely outside of my house. I've always had an internalized voice that made me want 
            to help other people and bring my contribution to the world. Witnessing the story of Malala shaped my idea 
            of what truly means making a difference, helping me becoming an active member of my community. Malala's strength 
            and work is something that I will always take inspiration from in times where I feel hopeless or overwhelmed by
            the circumstances. Her beliefs and her courage remain alive within every girl in the world.

        <h2 id="artist-statement">
            With this project I wanted to showcase the history of Malala Yousafzai and her family's
            courage and bravery. I wanted to document my own understanding of the situation as well as share my persepectives
            and how she impacted me growing up. Although making a powerpoint was my original intention, it became clear to me 
            rather quickly that I wanted to something more, I wanted to truly pay a lot of respect to her efforts and the 
            adversity her and her family had to face to get to where they are today, and showcase them for people of all 
            ages and backgrounds to see. This is why I chose to declare a website for users to freely look at the history of Malala's
            courage at their own pace, as well as enjoy the visual design of the webpage itself.
